1,A Day in the Life – Halfling,5,V/S/M,Touch,Creature Touched,Neg.,8,1 day,Priest,Alteration/Abjuration,Priest’s Spell Compendium Vol. 1,"This spell transforms a living, sentient, intelligent creature touched by the caster (successful attack roll required) into a normal halfling with no character class abilities (see the Monstrous Manual tome) provided the creature fails a saving throw vs. spell. The creature transformed retains its alignment, its memory and mental capacity, its normal saving throws, and its hit points. It does not gain the saving throw bonuses that halflings normally possess; the spell gives halfling form and THAC0. Items carried or worn are not changed with the creature, which may not be awash in ill-fitting armor or holding a weapon too big to wield effectively. Magical items usable only by character classes other than fighters no longer function for the creature. The casting of spells by a creature transformed by a day in the life is not possible, although they are not forgotten and can be cast when the creature once again assumes its normal form; similarly, the use of psionic capabilities granted by the psionicist class is not possible. The spell does not require  a system shock roll for the creature when it is transformed or when it assumes its normal form; at the spell’s expiration. 
The material components are the priest’s holy symbol and a hair from a halfling’s foot.
NOTE: Granted by the halfling deity Yondalla."
