		<Description>This spell enables the wizard to cause nonmagical fires - from as small as a torch or lantern to as large as the area of effect - to reduce in size and brightness to become mere coals or increase in light ot become as bright as full daylight and increase the illumination to dobule the normal radius. Note that this does not affect either fuel consumption or damage caused by the fire. The caster can affect any or all fires in the spell's area. He can alter their intensities with a single gesture as long as the spell is in effect. The spell lasts until caster cancels it, all fuel is burned, or the duration expires. The caster can also extinguish all flames in the area, which expends the spell immediately. The spell does not affect fire elements or similar creatures.</Description>

		<Description>When an alarm spell is cast, the wizard causes a selected area to react to the presence of any creature larger than a normal rat - anything larger than about 1/2 cubic foot in volume or more than about three pounds in weight. The area of effect can be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. As soon as any creature enters the warded area, touches it, or otherwise contacts it without speaking a password established by the caster, the alarm spell lets out a loud ringing that can be heard clearly within a 60ft. radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 feet for each interposing door  and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.) The sound lasts for one round and then ceases. Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do not trigger an alarm, but flying or levitating creatures, invisible creatures, or incorporeal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can dismiss the alarm witha  single word.
		The material components of this spell are a tiny bell and a piece of very fine silver wire.</Description>

		<Description>By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were scale mail armor (AC 6). The spell has no effect on a person already armored or a creature with Armor Class 6 or better. It is not cumulative with the shield spell, but it is cumulative with the Dexterity and, in case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The armor spell does not hinder movement or prevent spellcasting, and adds no weight or encumbrance. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the wearer sustains cumulative damage totaling greater than 8 points + 1 per level of the caster. (It is important to note that the armor does not absorb this damage. The armor merely grants an AC of 6; the wearer still suffers full damage from any successful attacks.) Thus, the wearer might suffer 8 points from an attack, then several minutes later sustain an additional 1 point of damage. Unless the spell were cast by a wizard of 2nd level or higher, it would be dispelled at this time. Until it is dispelled, the armor spell grants the wearer full benefits of the Armor Class gained.
		The material component is a piece of finely cured leather that has been blessed by a priest.</Description>

		<Description>When the <i>audible glamer</i> is cast, the wizard causes a volume fo sound to arise, at whatever distance he desires (within range), and seem to recede, approach, or remain at a fixed place as desired. The volume of sound created, however, is directly related to the level of the spellcaster. The volume is based upon the lowest level at which the spell can be cast, 1st level. The noise of the <i>audible glamer</i> at this level is that of four men, maximum. Each additional experience level of the wizard adds a like volume, so that at 2nd level the wizard can have the spell cause sound equal to that of eight men. Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The auditory illusion created by an <i>audible glamer</i> spell can be virtually any type of sound, but the relative volume must be commensurate with the level of the wizard casting the spell. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight men running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise volume of 16 men, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise volume of no fewer than 24 men.
			A character stating that he does not believe the sound receives a saving throw, and if it succeeds, the character then hears a faint and obviously false sound emanating from the caster's direction. Note that this spell can enhance the effectiveness of the <i>phantasmal force</i> spell.
			The material component of the spell is a bit of wool or a small lump of wax.</Description>

		<Description>When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from his fingertips. His hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: The wizard's thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets 5 feet long in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. Any creature in the area of the flames fuffers 1d3 points of damage, plus 2 points for each level of experience of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. spell receive half damage. Flammable materials touched by the fire burn (for example, cloth paper, parchment, thin wodd, ect.) Such materials can be extinguished in the next round if no other action is taken.</Description>

		<Description>Cantrips are minor spells studied by wizards during their apprenticeship, regardless of school. The cantrip spell is a practice method for the apprentice, teaching him how to tap minute amounts of magical energy. Once cast, the cantrip spell enables the caster to create minor magical effects for the duration of the spell. However, these effects are so minor that they have severe limitations. They are completely unable to cause a loss of hit points, cannot affect the concentratin of spellcasters, and can only create small obviously magical materials. Furthermore, materials created by a cantrip are extremely fragile and cannot be used as tools of any sort. Lastly, a cantrip lacks the power to duplicate an other spell effects.
                 Whatever manifestation the cantrip takes, it remains in effect only as long as the wizard concentrates. Wizards typically use cantrips to limpress common folk, amuse children, and brighten dreary lives. Common tricks with cantrips include tinklings of ethereal music, brightening faded flowers, glowing balls that float over the caster's hand, puffs of wind to flicker candles, spicing up aromas and flavors of bland food, and little whirlwinds to sweed dust under rugs. Combined with the unseen servant spell, it's a tool to make housekeeping and entertaining simpler for the wizard.</Description>

		<Description>This spell enables the wizard to alter the appearance of his form--including clothing and equipment--to appear 1 foot shorter or taller; thin, fat, or in between; human, humanoid, or any other generally man-shaped bipedal creature. The caster cannot duplicate a specific individual. The spell does not provide the abilities or mannerisms of the chosen form. The duration of the spell is 2d6 rounds plus two additional rounds per level of experience of the spellcaster. The DM may allow a saving throw for disbelief under certain circumstances: for example, if the caster acts in a manner obviously inconsistent with his chosen role. The spell does not alter the perceived tactile (i.e. touch) properties of the caster or his equipment, and the ruse can be discovered in this way.</Description>

		<Description>This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but and ogre could not.
                The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, with an adjustments due to Wisdom (see Table 5). If the person receives damage from the caster's group in the same round the charm is cast, an additional bonus of +1 per hit point of damage received is added to the victim's saving throw.
                If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way. Thus a charmed person would not obey a suicide command, but he might believe the caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the person ot hold back an onrushing red dragon for "just a minute or two." Note also that the spell does not endow the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond those lhe normally possesses (i.e., he must speak the victim's language to communicate his commands).
                The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed person's Intelligence and is tied ot the saving throw. The spell may be broken if a successful saving throw is rolled, and this saving throw is checked on a periodic basis, according ot the creatures' Intelligence (see the following table). If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or is a dispel magic spell is successfully cast updon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.
                If two or more charm effects simultaneously effect a creature, the result is decided by the DM. This could range from one effect being clearly dominant, to the subject being town by conflicting desires, to new saving throws that could negate both spells.
                Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed.
                (TABLE)
                NOTE: The period between checks is the time period during which the check occurs. When to roll the check during this time is determined (randomly or by selection) by the DM. The roll is made secretly.</Description>

		<Description>When  the  caster  completes  this  spell,  a  blue  glow  encompasses his  hand.  This  energy  attacks  the  life  force  of  any  living  creature upon  which  the  wizard  makes  a  successful  melee  attack.  The touched  creature  must  roll  a  successful  saving  throw  vs.  spell  or  suf­ fer  1d4  points  of damage  and  lose  I  point  of  Strength.  If  the  save  is successful,  the  creature  remains  unharmed.  Creatures  not  rated  for Strength  suffer  a  -1  penalty  to  their  attack  rolls  for  every  other  suc­ cessful  touch.  Lost  Strength  returns  at  the  rate  of  1  point  per  hour. Damage  must  be  cured  magically  or  healed  naturally. 
This  spell  has  a  special  effect  on  undead  creatures.  Undead touched  by  the  caster  suffer  no  damage  or  Strength  loss,  but  they must  successfully  save  vs.  spell  or  flee  for  1d4  rounds  +  1  round per  level  of  the  caster.</Description>

		<Description>Upon  casting  this  spell,  the  wizard  causes  a  vivid,  fan-shaped spray  of  clashing  colors  to  spring  forth  from  his  hand.  From  one  to six  creatures  (Id6)  within  the  area  are  affected  in  order  of  increas­ ing  distance  from  the  wizard.  All  creatures  above  the  level  of  the spellcaster  and  all  those  of  6th  level  or  6  Hit  Dice  or  more  are  enti­ tled  to  a  saving  throw  vs.  spell.  Blind  or  unseeing  creatures  are  not affected  by  the  spell. 
Creatures  not  allowed  or  failing  saving  throws,  and  whose  Hit Dice  or  levels  are  less  than  or  equal  to  the  spellcaster's  level,  are struck  unconscious  for  2d4  rounds;  those  with  Hit  Dice  or  levels  I or  2  greater  than  the  wizard's  level  are  blinded  for  1d4  rounds; those  with  Hit  Dice  or  levels  3  or  more  greater  than  that  of  the  spell­ caster  are  stunned  (reeling  and  unable  to  think  or  act  coherently)  for one  round.

		<Description>When  this  spell  is  cast,  the  wizard  is  able  to  understand  the  spo­ ken  words  of  a  creature  or  read  an  otherwise  incomprehensible  writ­ 
ten  message  (such  as  writing  in  another  language).  In  either  case, the  wizard  must  touch  the  creature  or  the  writing.  Note  that  the  abill­ ity  to  read  does  not  necessarily  impart  understanding  of  the  mater­ ial,  nor  does  the  spell  enable  the  caster  to  speak  or  write  an unknown  language.  Written  material  can  be  read  at  the  rate  of  one page  or  equivalent  per  round.  Magical  writing  cannot  be  read,  other than  to  know  it  is  magical,  but  the  spell  is  often  useful  when  deci­ phering  treasure  maps.  This  spell  can  be  foiled  by  certain  warding magic  (the  3rd-level  secret  page  and  illusionary  script  spells),  and  it 
does  not  reveal  messages  concealed  in  otherwise  normal  text. The  material  components  of  this  spell  are  a  pinch  of  soot  and  a few  grains  of  salt.
The  reverse  of  this  spell,  confuse  languages,  cancels  a  compre­ hend  languages  spell  or  renders  a writing  or  a  creature's  speech incomprehensible,  for  the  same  duration  as  above. </Description>

The  dancing  lights  move  as  the  spellcaster desires,  forward  or  back,  straight  or  turning  corners,  without  concen­ tration  upon  such  movement  by  the  wizard.  The  spell  cannot  be used  to  cause  blindness  (see  the  1st-level  light  spell),  and  it  winks out  if  the  range  or  duration  is  exceeded. 
The  material  component  of  this  spell  is  either  a  bit  of  phospho­ rus  or  wychwood,  or  a  glowworm. </Description>

The  intensity  of  the  magic  can  be  determined  (dim, faint,  moderate,  strong,  overwhelming),  and  the  wizard  has  a  100% chance  per  level  to  recognize  if  a  certain  type  of  magic  (alteration, conjuration,  etc.)  is  present.

A  stone  wall  of  1  foot  or  more  thickness,  solid metal  of  1  inch  thickness,  or  a  yard  or  more  of  solid  wood  blocks  the spell.

		<Description>
			This spell causes instant growth of a creature or object increasing both size and weight. It can be cast only upon a single creature (or a symbiotic or community entity) or upon a single object that does not exceed 10 cubic feet in volume per caster level. The object or creature must be seen to be affected. it grows by up to 10% per the level of the wizard increasing this amound in height, width, and weight.
			All equipmentworn or carried by a creature is enlarged by the spell. Unwilling victims are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell. A successful saving throw means the spell fails. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size, bursting weak enclosures in the process, but it is constrained without harm by stronger materials--the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by growth.
			Magical properties are not increased by this spell--a huge <i>sword +1</i> is still only a +1, a staff-sized wand is still only capable of its normal functions, a giant-sized potion merely requires a greater fluid intake to make its magical effects operate, etc. Weight, mass, and strength are affected, though. Thus, a table blocking a door would be heavier and more effective, a hurled stone would have more mass (and cause more damage), chains would be more massive, doors thicker, a thin line turned to a sizeable, longer rope, and so on. A creature's hit points, Armor Class, and attack rolls do not change, but damage rolls increase proportionately with size.
			For example, a fighter at 160% normal size hits with his long sword and rolls a 6 for damage. The adjusted damage rolle is 10 (that is 6 x 1.6 = 9.6, rounded up). Bonuses due to Strength, class, and magic are not altered.
			The reverse spell, <i>reduce</i>, negates the <i>enlarge</i> spell or makes creatures or objects smaller. The creature or object loses 10% of its original size for every level of the caster, to a minimum of 10% of the original size. Thereafter, the size shrinks by 1-foot increments to less that 1 foot, by 1-inch increments to 1 inch, and by 1/10-inch increments to a minimum of 1/10 of an inch--the recipient cannot dwindle away to nothingness.
			for example, a 16-foot-tall giant reduced by a 15th-level wizard (15 steps) would be reduced to 1.6 feet (in nine steps), then to 6/10 of a foot or 72 inches (in one step), and finally to 2.2 inches (in the last five steps). A shrinking object may damage weaker materials affixed  to it, but an object will shrink only as long the object itself is not damaged. Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. spell.
			The material component of this spell is a pinch of powdered iron.

Nonmagical writings are automatically erased  if the caster is touching them, otherwise, the chance for success is 90%. Magical writings must be touched, and are only 30% likely to be erased, plus 5% per caster level, to a maximum of 90% (for example, 35% for a 1st-level caster, 40% for a 2nd-level caster, etc.).

		<Description>
			When this spell is cast, the creature(s) or object(s) affected immediately assumes the mass of a piece of down. The rate of falling is instantly changed to a mere 2 feet per second (120 feet per round), and no damage is incurred upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration ceases, a normal rate of fall occurs. The spell can be cast upon the wizard or some other creature or object up to the maximum range and lasts for one round for each level of the wizard. The <i>feather fall</i> affects one or more objects or creatures in a 10-foot cube, as long as the maximum weight of the creatures or objects does not exceed a combined total of 200 pounds plus 200 pounds per level of the spellcaster.
			For example, a 2nd-level wizard has a range of 20 yards, a duration of two rounds, and a weight limit of 600 pounds when casting this spell. The spell works only upon free-falling, flying, or propelled objects (such as missiles). It does not affect a sword blow or a charging creature. Note that the spell can be effectively combined with <i>gust of wind</i> and similar spells.

		<Description>
			This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures, such as cats, frogs, ferrets, crows, hawks, snakes, owls, ravens, toads, weasels, or even mice. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, however, and he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any at all come.
			The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard receives the heightened sense of his familiar, which grants the wizard a +1 bonus to all surprise die rolls. Normal familiars have 2-4 hit points plus 1 hit point per caster level, and an Armor Class of 7 (due to size, speed, etc.).
			The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands at a distance of up to 1 mile. Note that empathic responses from the familiar are generally fairly basic--while able to communicate simple thoughts, these are often overwhelmed by instinctual responses. Thus, a ferret familiar spying on a band of orcs in the woods might lose its train of thought upon sighting a mouse. Certainly its communication to its master could be tinged with fear of the "big ones" is was spying on! The caster cannot see through the familiar's eyes.
			If separated from the caster, the familiar loses 1 hit point each day, and dies if reduced to 0 hit points. When the familiar is in physical contact with its wizard, it gains the wizard's saving throws against special attacks. If a special attack would normally cause damage, the familiar suffers no damage if the saving throw is successful and half damage if the saving throw is failed. If the familiar dies, the wizard must successfully roll an immediate system shock check or die. Even if he survives this check, the wizard loses 1 point from his Constitution when the familiar dies.
			The power of the conjuration is such that it can be attempted but once per year. When the wizard decides to find a familiar, he must load a brass brazier with charcoal. When this is burning well, he adds 1,000 gp worth of incense and herbs. The spell incantation is then begun and must be continued until the familiar comes or the casting time is finished. The DM secretly determines all results. Note that most familiars are not inherently magical, nor does a <i>dispel magic</i> spell send them away.
			Deliberate mistreatment, failure to feed and care for the familiar, or continuous unreasonable demands have adverse effeects on the familiar's relationship with its master. Purposely arranging the death of one's own familiar incurs great disfavor from certain powerful entities, with dire results.

			A <i>friends</i> spell causes the wizard to temporarily gain 2d4 points of Charisma. Intelligent creatures within the area of effect at the time the spell is cast must make immediate reaction checks based on the character's new Charisma. Those with favorable reactions tend to be very impressed with the spellcaster and make an effort to be his friends and help him, as appropriate to the situation. Officious bureaucrats might decide to become helpful; surly gate guards might wax informative; attacking orcs might spare the caster's life, taking him captive instead. When the spell wears off, the creatures realize that they have been influenced, and their reactions are determiend by the DM.
			The components for this spell are chalk (or white flour), lamp-black (or soot), and vermillion applied to the face before casting the spell.

			The <i>gaze reflection</i> spell creates a shimmering, mirrorlike area of air before the wizard that moves with the caster. Any gaze attack, such as that of a basilisk, <i>eyes of charming</i>, a vampire's gaze, the 6th-level <i>eyebite</i> spell, and son on, is reflected back upon the gazer if the gazer tries to make eye contact with the spellcaster (the spellcaster suffers no effects from the gaze attack). Such creatures receive a saving throw vs. their own gaze effect. The spell does not affect vision or lighting and is not effective against creatures whose effect comes from being gazed upon (such as a medusa). Only active gaze attacks are blocked by this spell.

		<Description>
			A <i>grease</i> spell covers a material surface with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. spell or slip, skid, and fall. Those who successfully save can reach the nearest non<i>greased</i> surface by the end of the round. Those who remain in the area are allowed a saving throw each round until they escape the area. The DM should adjust saving throws by circumstance; for example, a creature charging down an incline that is suddenly greased has little chance to avoid the effect, but its ability to exit the affected area is almost assured. The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item--a rope, ladder rungs, weapon handle, etc. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while creatures wielding or employing items receive a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw is failed, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made each round the creature attempts to use the greased item. The caster can end the effect with a single utterance; otherwise, it lasts for three rounds plus one round per level.
			The material component of the spell is a bit of pork rind or butter.

			The gestures of the wizard, along with his droning incantation, cause 1d6 creatures within the area to become susceptible to a suggestion--a brief and reasonable-sounding request (see the 3rd-level wizard <i>suggestion</i> spell). The request must be given after the <i>hypnotism</i> spell is cast. Until that time, the success of the spell is unknown. Note that the subsequent suggestion is not a spell, but simply a vocalized urging (the caster must speak a language the creature understands for this spell to work). Creatures that successfully roll their saving throws are not under hypnotic influence. Those who are exceptionally wary or hostile save with +1 to +3 bonuses. If the spell is cast at an individual creature that meets the caster's gaze, the saving throw is made with a penalty of -2. A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that the caster enspelled it.

		<Description>
			When an <i>identify</i> spell is cast, magical items subsequently touched by the wizard can be identified. The eight hours immediately preceding the casting of the spell must be spent purifying the items and removing influences that would corrupt and blur their magical auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again. When the spell is cast, each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any consequences of this handling fall fully upoon the wizard and may end the spell, although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw.
			The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to 10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90% rolled by the DM. Any roll fo 96-00 indicates a false reading (91-95 reveals nothing). Only one function of a multifunction item is discovered per handling (i.e., a 5th-level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five different items, five different functions of a single item, or any combination of the two). If any attempt  at reading fails, the caster cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified with this spell.
			The item never reveals its exact attack or damage bonuses, although the fact that it has few or many bonuses can be determine. If it has charges, only a general indication of the number of charges remaining is learned: powerful (81% - 100% fo the total possible charges), strong (61% - 80%), moderate (41% - 60%), weak (6% - 40%), or faint (five charges or less). The faint result takes precedence, so a fully charged <i>ring of three wishes</i> always appears to be only faintly charged.
			After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it, the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious. Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored, which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for an unconscious character).
			The material components of this spell are a pearl (of at least 100 gp value) and an owl feather steeped  in wine; the infusion must be drunk prior to spellcasting. If a <i>luckstone</i> is powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more potent. Exact bonuses or charges can be determined, and the functions of a multifunctional item can be learned from a single reading. At the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact or relic might alse be learned.

			This spell creates a luminous glow, equal to torchlight, within a fixed radius of the spell's center. Objects in darkness beyond this sphere can be seen, at best, as vague and shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a point selected by the caster, and he must have a line of sight and unobstructed path for the spell when it is cast. Light can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar substance.
			The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a moveable object or mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, the applicable magic resistance and saving throw rolls must be made. Successful resistance negates the spell, while a successful saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature, rather than upon the creature itself. Light taken into an area of magical darkness negates it (but only for the duration of the <i>light</i> spell, if the darkness effect is continual).
			Light centered  on the visual organs of a creature blinds it, reducing its attack rolls and saving throws by 4 and worsening its Armor Class by 4. The caster can end the spell at any time by uttering a single word.
			The material component is a firefly or a piece of phosphorescent moss.

    Use of the <i>magic missile</i> spell creates up to five missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target. This includes enemy creatures in a melee. The target creature must be seen or otherwise detected to be hit, however, so near-total concealment, such as that offered by arrow slits, can render the spell ineffective. Likewise, the caster must be able to identify the target. He cannot direct a magic missile to "Strike the commander of the legion," unless he can single out the commander from the rest of the soldiers. Specific parts of a creature cannot be singled out. Inanimate objects (locks, etc.) cannot be damaged by the spell, and any attempt to do so wastes the missiles ot no effect. Against creatures, each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage.
			For every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile--he has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles at 9th level. If the wizard has multiple missile capability, he can have them strike a single target creature or several creatures, as desired.

This spell does not, by itself, repair magical items of any type. One turn after the spell is cast, the magic of the joining fades and the effect cannot be magically dispelled. The maximum volume of material the caster can mend is 1 cubic foot per level.
			The material components of this spell are two small magnets of any type (lodestone in all likelihood) or two burrs.

			When this spell is cast, the wizard can whisper messages and receive replies with little chance of being overheard. When the spell is cast, the wizard secretly or openly points his finger at each creature to be included in the spell effect. Up to one creature per level can be included. When the wizard whispers, the whispered message travels in a straight line and is audible to all of the involved creatures within 30 feet, plus 10 feet per level of the caster. The creatures who receive the message can whisper a reply that is heard by the spellcaster. Note that there must be an unobstructed path between the spellcaster and the recipients of the spell. The message must be in a language the caster speaks; this spell does not by itself confer understanding upon the recipients. Thi spell is most often used to conduct quick and private conferences when the caster does not wish to be overheard.

			By means of this spell, the caster conjures a normal animal to serve him as a mount. The animal serves willingly and well, but at the expiration of the spell duration and disappears, returning to its own place. The type of mount gained by this spell depends on the level of the caster; of course, a caster can choose a lesser mount if desired. Available mounts include the following:
			Caster level     mount
			1-3              Mule or light horse
			4-7              Draft horse or war horse
			8-12             Camel
			13-14            Elephant (and howdah at 18th level)
			15+              Griffon (and saddle at 18th level)

			The mount does not come with any riding gear, unless it is of a class lower than the caster would normally be entitled to; thus, a 4th-level wizard can gain a war horse without saddle and harness, or a light horse with saddle and harness. The statistics of the animal gained are typical of all creatures of the same class. The mount disappears when slain.
			The material component of the spell is a bit of hair from the type of animal to be conjured.

Furthermore, the caster can specify the type of magical aura that is detected (alteration, conjuration, etc.) and this effectively masks the item's actual aura, if any, unless the item's own aura is exceptionally powerful (if it is an artifact, for instance). If the object bearing Nystul's magical aura has an <i>identify</i> spell cast on it or is similarly examined, the examiner has a 50% chance of recognizing that the aura has been placed to mislead the unwary.

			The component for this spell is a small square of silk, which must be passed over the object that receives the aura.

			This spell creates the illusion of an object, creature or force, as long as it is within the boundaries of the spell's area of effect. The illusion is visual and affects all believing creatures (undead are immune) that view it. It does not create sound, smell, or temperature. Effects that depend on these senses usually fail. The illusion lasts until struck by an opponent--unless the spellcaster causes the illusion to react appropriately--or until the wizard ceases concentration upon the spell (due to desire, moving, or a successful attack that causes damage). Saving throws for illusions are explained under "Illusions" in Chapter 7: Magic and under "Adjudicating Illusions" at the beginning of Appendix 2. Creatures that disbelieve the illusion see it for what it is and add +4 to associates' saving throws if this knowledge can be communicated effectively. Creatures believing the illusion are subject to its effects (again, as explained in Chapter 7).
			The illusionary effect can be moved by the caster within the limits of the area of effect. The DM has to rule on the effectiveness of this spell; detailed guidelines are outlined in Chapter 7: Magic and under "Adjudicating Illusions" at the beginning of Appendix 2.
			The material component of the spell is a bit of fleece.

		<Description>
			When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has three major effects:
			First, all attacks made by evil (or evilly enchanted) creatures against the protected creature suffer -2 penalties to attack rolls; any saving throws caused by such attacks are made with +2 bonuses.
			Second, any attempt to possess (as by a <i>magic jar</i> attack) or to exercise mental control over (as by a vampire's <i>charm</i> ability) the protected creature is blocked by this spell. Note that the protection does not prevent a vampire's <i>charm</i> itself, but it does prevent the exercise of mental control through the barrier. Likewise, a possessing life force is merely kept out. It would not be expelled if in place before the protection is cast.
			Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil, if such attacks require touching the protected being. Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise hedged from the character.
			This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.
			To complete this spell, the wizard must trace a 3-foot-diameter circle on the floor (or ground) with powdered silver.
			This spell can be reversed to become <i>protection from good</i>; the second and third benefits remain unchanged. The material component for the reverse is a circle of powdered iron.

		<Description>
			By means of a <i>read magic</i> spell, the wizard is able to read magical inscriptions on objects--books, scrolls, weapons, and the like--that would otherwise by totaly unintelligible. (The personal books of the wizard, and works already magically read, are intelligible.) This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and the wizard has read the magical inscription, he is thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of the <i>read magic</i> spell. The duration of the spell is two rounds per level of experience of the spellcaster; the wizard can read one page or its equivalent per round.
			The wizard must have a clear crystal or mineral prism, which is not expended, to cast the spell.

		<Description>
			When this spell is cast an invisible barrier comes into being in front of the wizard. This shield totally negates magic missile attacks. It provides the equivalent protection of AC 2 against hand-hurled missiles (axes, darts, javelins, spears, etc.), AC 3 against small device-propelled missiles (arrows, bolts, bullets, manticore spikes, sling stones, etc.), and AC 4 against Available other forms of attack. The shield also adds a +1 bonus to the wizard's saving throws against attacks that are basically frontal. Note that these benefits apply only if the attacks originate from in front of the wizard, where the shield can move to interpose itself.

		<Description>
			When the wizard casts this spell, he develops a powerful electrical charge that give a jolt to the creature touched. The spell remains in effect for one round per level of the caster or until is is discharged by the caster touching another creature. The shocking grasp delivers 1d8 points of damage, plus 1 point per level of the wizard (for example, a 2nd-level wizard would discharge a shock causing a 1d8+2 points of damage). While the wizard must come close enough to his opponent to lay a hand on the opponent's body or upon an electrical conductor that touches the opponent's body, a like touch from the opponent does not discharge the spell.

		<Description>
			When a wizard casts a <i>sleep</i> spell, he causes a comatose slumber to come upon one or more creatures (other than undead and certain other creatures specifically excluded from the spell's effects). All creatures to be affected by the <i>sleep</i> spell must be within 30 feet of each other. The number of creatures that can be affected is a function of Hit Dice or levels. The spell affects 2d4 Hit Dice of monsters. Monsters with 4+3 Hit Dice(4 Hit Dice plus 3 hit points) or more are unaffected. The center of the area of effect is determined by the spellcaster. The creatures with the least Hit Dice are affected first, and partial effects are ignored.
			For example, a wizard casts <i>sleep</i> at three kobolds, two gnolls, and an ogre. The roll (2d4) result is 4. All the kobolds and the one gnoll are affected(1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 2 = 3 1/2 Hit Dice). Note that the remainder is not enough to affect the last gnoll or the ogre.
			Slapping or wounding awakens affected creatures but normal noise does not. Awakening requires one entire round. Magically sleeping opponents can be attacked with substantial bonuses (see "Modifiers to the Attack Roll" in Chapter 9: Combat).
			The material component for this spell is a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a live cricket.

		<Description>
			A <i>spider climb</i> spell enables the recipient to climb and travel upon vertical surfaces as well as a giant spider, or even hang upside down from ceilings. Unwilling victims must be touched and are then allowed a saving throw vs. spell to negate the effect. The affected creature must have bare hands and feet in order to climb in this manner, at a movement rate of 6 (3 if at all encumbered). During the course fo the spell, the recipient cannot handle objects that weight less than a dagger (one pound), for such objects stick to his hands and feet. Thus, a wizard will find it virtually impossible to cast spells if under a <i>spider climb</i> spell. Sufficient force can pull the recipient free; the DM can assign a saving throw based on circumstances, the strength of the force, and so on. For example, a creature with a Strength of 12 might pull the subject free if the subject fails a saving throw vs. paralyzation (a moderately difficult saving throw). The caster can end the spell effect with a word.
			The material components of this spell are a drop of bitumen and a live spider, both of which must be eaten by the spell recipient.

		<Description>
			A <i>spook</i> spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the spellcaster as someone or something inimical. Without actually knowing what this is, the wizard merely advances threateningly upon the creature. If the creature does not make a successful saving throw vs. spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far  from the wizard  as possible, though items carried are not dropped. The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Note that a natural (unmodified) roll of 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of saving throw penalties. Although the caster does not acutally pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Each round after the initial casting, the creature receives another saving throw, without penalty, until it successfully saes and the spell is broken. In any event, the spell functions only against creatures with Intelligences of 2 or more, and undead are not affected at all.

		<Description>
			A <i>taunt</i> sepll enables the caster to jape and jeer effectively at a single type of creature with an intelligence of 2 or greater. The caster need not speak the language of the creatures. His words and sounds have real meaning for the subjeect creature or creatures, challenging, insulting, and generally irritating and angering the listeners. Those failing to save vs. spell rush forth in fury to do battle with the spellcaster. All affected creatures attack the spellcaster in melee if physically capable of doing so, seeking to use body or hand-held weapons rather than missile weapons or spells.
			Separation of the caster form the victim by an impenetrable or uncrossable boundary (a wall of fire, a deep chasm, a formation of set pikemen) causes the spell to break. If the caster taunts a mixed group, he must choose the type of creature to be affected. Creatures commanded by a strong leader (i.e., with a Charisma bonus, with higher Hit Dice, etc.) might gain a saving throw bonus of +1 to +4, at the DM's discretion. If used in conjunction with a <i>ventriloquism</i> spell, the creatures may attack the apparent source, depending upon their intelligence, a leader's presence, and so on.
			The material component is a slug, which is hurled at the creature to be taunted.

		<Description>
			With this spell, the caster creates the slightly concave, circular plane of force known as Tenser's floating disc (after the famed wizard whose greed and ability to locate treasure are well known). The disc 3 feet in diameter and holds 100 pounds  of weight per level of the wizard casting the spell. The disc floats approximately 3 feet above the ground at all times and remains level. It floats along horizontally within its range of 20 yards at the command of the caster, and will accompany him at a movement rate of no more than 6. If unguided, it maintains a constant interval of 6 feet between itself and the wizard. If the spellcaster moves beyond range. (by moving faster, by such means as a <i>teleport</i> spell, or by trying to take the disc more than 3 feet from the surface beneath it), or if the spell duration expires, the floating disc winks out of existence, and whatever it was supporting crashes to the surface beneath it.
			The material component of the spell is a drop of mercury.

		<Description>
			The unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, and shapeless force, used to step and fetch, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as to clean and mend. It is not strong, but unfailingly obeys the command of the wizard. It can perfom only one activity at a time and can move only lightweight items, carrying a maximum of 20 pounds of pushing/pulling 40 pounds across a smooth surface. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, etc. The unseen servant cannot fight, nor can it be killed, as it is a force rather than a creature. It can be magically dispelled, or eliminated after receiving 6 points of damage from area-effect spells, breath weapons, or similar attacks. If the caster attempts to send it beyond the allowed radius, the spell ends immediately.
			The material components fo the spell are a piece of string and a bit of wood.

		<Description>
			This spell enables the wizard to make his voice--or someone else's voice--or a similar sound seem to issue from someplace else, such as from another creature, a statue, from behind a door, down a passage, etc. The spellcaster can speak in any language that he knows, or make any sound that he can normally make. With respect to such voices and sounds, anyone rolling a successful saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty detects the ruse. If cast in conjunction with other illusions, the DM may rule greater penalties or disallow an independent saving throw against this spell in consideration of its contribution to the total effect of the combined illusion.
			The material component of this spell is a parchment rolled up into a small cone.
